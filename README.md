# Bike_Lock_android_app
An android application that had two components - a lock app and a mobile app to connect to the lock via Firebase.

The lock app was made to mimic the actual lock that could be deployed in real life. The function of the app was to detect
any attempt to steal the bike that it would be deployed on using the accelerometer data. This lock app has the ability to 
put up an alarm in extreme case so that the nearby people can be alerted and would also send a notification to the user that
has the mobile app. This lock also used Google API that could fetch real time coordinates and mirror it to the mobile app.

The mobile app that the user would use to interact with the lock. The app has a simple UI that supports a no. of features-
The user can switch on/off the lock depending on the condition.
The user can see the real time location of the lock.
The user can switch off the alarm in case of false positive.

This system was designed to tackle the rising issue of bike thefts in Melbourne and create an effective design of a smart lock
that can protect the bike. This system also has a specific physical design that will prevent any part to be stolen from the bike
These apps interact through firebase and we can observe real time data form the server side and can also provide centralised
service to the users.
